On the third day of the competition — following the cancellation of day 2 due to weather — participants faced a 150 km stage. 
Our volunteers responded to a motorcycle incident:
- Two auto/SSV teams dispatched 
- Response time: 6 minutes
- Rider stabilized and handed over to SMURD in stable condition
- Returned safely to bivouac.

We remained in the field until the competition's end.
