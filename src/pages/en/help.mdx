        I agree that I am requesting help from the A.D.C.S. community and that I am not in a critical situation requiring a call to the emergency number 112. I understand that my request may be rejected if it does not fall within the scope of A.D.C.S. activities. I agree that volunteers are not liable for any damages, and that my data (name, phone number, location) will be made available to the community.
